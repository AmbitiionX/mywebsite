<h1>Enter: Yashin</h1> 
	<p>My character’s name is Yashin. He is roughly 5’8”, has an athletic build and very muscular definition. He has dreadlocks with purple highlights found between and a black and white headband with special markings. He dons a black mask most of the time and can never be seen without his two swords of choice, Heaven and Earth</p>
